üìå Project Overview
This project focuses on detecting human facial emotions in real-time using a deep learning model trained on the Face Expression Recognition Dataset from Roboflow. The model classifies emotions such as happy, sad, angry, fearful, surprised, neutral, and disgusted from live or static facial inputs. when you run the file realtime_emotion_detector it takes the live input and predicts

üìà Future Scope
Smart Surveillance Integration: Deploy on CCTV systems in public spaces (e.g., railway stations, bus stands).
Real-Time Threat Detection: Automatically detect and flag individuals showing signs of fear, distress, or panic.
Emergency Response: Trigger alerts to nearby authorities or police units when suspicious or dangerous emotional states are consistently observed.
Behavioral Analytics: Analyze crowd emotion trends during events for safety or engagement metrics.
